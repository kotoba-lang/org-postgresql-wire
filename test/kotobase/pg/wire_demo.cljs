;; Not a unit test -- an EXECUTABLE end-to-end demo that must genuinely
;; pass when run, matching the verification style
;; ADR-2607161817/kotoba-lang/dtn's tcp_demo.cljs and
;; kotoba-lang/org-ietf-sftp's ssh_demo.cljs established: it spawns an
;; actual second `nbb` OS process (bin/pg_node.cljs, this repo's own
;; server binary, invoked directly via node:child_process -- found by
;; relative path, not $PATH), connects to its real bound TCP port from
;; THIS process (acting as a minimal, hand-rolled Postgres wire CLIENT --
;; there is no general-purpose client in this repo, see
;; kotobase.pg.wire's own docstring: "no real client library is
;; offered"), and proves the real chain:
;;
;;   SSLRequest -> deny byte 'N' -> real StartupMessage -> real
;;   AuthenticationOk/ParameterStatus*/BackendKeyData/ReadyForQuery ->
;;   real simple-query Query('Q') messages against the SECOND PROCESS's
;;   own in-memory kotobase.local store, routed through
;;   kotobase.pg.sql's real parser/translator/executor and
;;   kotobase-query's real materialize+arrangement.datalog join engine
;;   -> real RowDescription/DataRow/CommandComplete responses whose
;;   actual byte content is decoded and checked against the fixture data
;;   -- AND an out-of-scope query (COUNT(*)) genuinely producing a real
;;   ErrorResponse rather than silently mis-executing -> Terminate.
;;
;; This is proof by protocol response content, not proof by log line: if
;; the message framing, length fields, startup-code classification, or
;; kotobase.pg.sql translation were wrong, the responses below would
;; either never arrive in a well-formed shape (this client's own
;; incremental reader would stall waiting for bytes that never
;; complete a message, timing out) or would decode to values that don't
;; match the known fixture data in bin/pg_node.cljs.
;;
;; HONEST SCOPE: this proves this repo's OWN hand-rolled client (this
;; file) and OWN server (kotobase.pg.wire) correctly interoperate with
;; EACH OTHER, across two real OS processes, over a real TCP socket. It
;; does NOT prove interop with a real `psql`/`libpq`/any off-the-shelf
;; Postgres driver -- no such test exists in this repo, and none is
;; claimed. See the README's "What's actually verified" table.
;;
;; Prints PASS/FAIL per check, a final "RESULT: N/M checks passed" line,
;; and exits 0 iff every check passed (else 1). Run from this repo's
;; root:
