(ns kotobase.pg.sql
  "A small, real SQL subset, hand-parsed and executed via
  `kotobase.query.bridge` (`kotoba-lang/kotobase-query`) -- the pure
  `.cljc` translator/executor half of `org-postgresql-wire`
  (ADR-2607172300 in `com-junkawasaki/root`). No socket / binary wire
  protocol concept lives here at all -- `kotobase.pg.wire` (`.cljs`-only)
  is the only namespace in this repo that knows about bytes on a socket;
  this namespace only ever sees/returns Clojure data. Same
  core/transport separation `kotobase.sftp.fs` (`kotoba-lang/org-ietf-sftp`)
  established for its own protocol family.

  ## v0.1 SQL subset -- READ THIS BEFORE EXTENDING (a deliberate scope
  boundary, owner-confirmed in ADR-2607172300, not laziness)

  Exactly one shape is supported:

      SELECT <col1>, <col2>, ... FROM <collection> WHERE <col> = <literal>

  - single table (`FROM` names exactly one `kotobase.store` collection)
  - the `WHERE` clause is OPTIONAL, but if present is exactly ONE
    `<col> = <literal>` equality predicate -- no `AND`/`OR`, no `<`/`>`/
    `<>`/`LIKE`/`IN`/`IS NULL`, no predicates on more than one column.
  - `<literal>` is a single-quoted string, an integer/decimal number,
    `TRUE`/`FALSE`, or `NULL`.
  - `SELECT` list is an explicit, non-empty column list -- `SELECT *` is
    explicitly rejected (see `parse`'s docstring), not silently
    interpreted as some default projection.

  Deliberately, explicitly UNSUPPORTED and REJECTED WITH A CLEAR ERROR
  (never silently mis-executed or silently ignored) -- this is the exact
  boundary the ADR draws:

  - joins (multiple tables in `FROM`, any `JOIN` keyword)
  - aggregates (`COUNT`/`SUM`/`AVG`/`MIN`/`MAX`/any function-call syntax
    in the `SELECT` list)
  - subqueries (a nested `SELECT` anywhere)
  - `ORDER BY` / `GROUP BY` / `LIMIT` / `OFFSET` / `DISTINCT`
  - `SELECT *`
  - anything past a single `<col> = <literal>` `WHERE` predicate

  ## Doc -> row mapping

  Delegates entirely to `kotobase.query.bridge`'s doc -> datoms mapping
  (see that namespace's docstring): a `SELECT` column name is looked up
  as a top-level attribute key (as a keyword, e.g. SQL column `role`
  reads doc attribute `:role`) on each entity materialized from the
  named `FROM` collection. A row is produced only for entities that have
  a value for EVERY selected column (and, if present, the `WHERE`
  column) -- an entity missing one of those attributes simply does not
  appear in the result set, matching how `arrangement.datalog`'s pattern
  matching already behaves (an unbound clause drops the row, it does not
  produce a `NULL` cell) and how `kotobase.query.bridge`'s own
  `join-across-two-materialized-collections` test documents this same
  behavior for its `[?u :dept-key ?dk]` clause. Callers that need `NULL`
  for a genuinely-missing column would need a richer query shape than
  this v0.1 subset provides -- out of scope here, named so it is not
  mistaken for an oversight.

  ## `visible?` is required, not defaulted

  `execute`/`query` both take `visible?` as a REQUIRED argument and pass
  it straight through to `kotobase.query.bridge/query` -- the same
  discipline the bridge itself enforces (ADR-2607050500, no permissive
  default). `kotobase.pg.wire` threads its own caller-supplied
  `visible?` through to this namespace; it does not invent one."
