;; A minimal CLI over kotobase.pg.wire -- a demo/dev tool, NOT a
;; production daemon. No config file, no persistence beyond one
;; process's in-memory kotobase.local store (pre-seeded with a small
;; fixture dataset so the cross-process demo has something real to
;; query), no real authentication (see kotobase.pg.wire's own docstring
;; -- every StartupMessage is unconditionally answered AuthenticationOk).
;; Good for exercising the wire protocol by hand or from the E2E demo
;; (test/kotobase/pg/wire_demo.cljs, which spawns this file as a real
;; second OS process) -- NOT for running on the open internet.
;;
;; Usage:
;;   nbb --classpath "src:test:<deps...>" bin/pg_node.cljs \
;;     listen --port 6543
;;   ;; -> starts a long-running Postgres-wire server on
;;   ;;    127.0.0.1:<port>, serving a fresh in-memory kotobase.local
;;   ;;    store pre-seeded with a "users" collection (see fixture-store
;;   ;;    below -- the exact same shape kotobase.pg.sql-test's own
;;   ;;    fixture uses). Prints "pg_node listening on port <port>" once
;;   ;;    bound, then stays alive until killed.
